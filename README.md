# About Me

ðŸ‘‹ Hello! Hi, I am Firdavs, a 17-year-old young programmer from the Uzbekistan, which is located in Central Asia of the world wide geography, and I like to code and explore the new ways of technology. I strongly believe that lifelong learning is the key to success and continually succeed in the world of software development by pushing boundaries.


The fields to which I relate include both frontend and backend programming There are frontend like HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and jQuery which I learned during the course. Nonetheless, I have no doubt that I will make extra efforts in learning JS since I believe that it's the key language in contemporary web designing.


As for the back-end side, I have decent in Python, Django, and Django Rest Framework. I love writing the server-side code that drives web applications, and designing and constructing solid APIs holds significant appeal to me.


Furthermore, I carry on by delving into the Flutter Android app segment. One codebase produces both the apps that contain appealing features and application for both Android and iOS platforms.


Right now, my main goal is to dive deeper into JavaScript and frontend developments because I agree that in order to keep up with the times and be able to make bleeding edge web pages, you need to learn those newest technologies. In the backend, I am involved in the challenging Django and Django Rest Framework implementation, and I humbly invite everyone else who feel the same.


Do you need help connecting, techie questions, or a way to share your insights with the community, feel free to get in touch. Let's foster and build our skills around software development constantly since it remains one of the rapidly growing fields today.
