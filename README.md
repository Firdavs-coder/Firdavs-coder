<h3 ><i style="color: yellow!important;"> Hi, My name is Firdavs, I am 17 years old and have been involved in programming for 2 years i.e. I decided to do a self study because there is no IT center in my 
district. I stumbled a lot on this but didn’t give up. First of all I learned html, css and js, which of course everyone should learn. After much hesitation, I decided 
to learn Python because the demand for this language was growing. After learning the backend part, I became interested in mobile programming i.e. I wanted to be a 
fullstack. By the way, I saw Backend in 3 months of English videos even though I don’t speak English. I started mobile programming in Dart language and I am still 
studying and while studying I introduced one real practice i.e. Taxi app to my district. I have not had much success but I am thirsty to learn. Also, many of my projects 
have not seen the public face. </i> </h3>

    <td>This project is one of the my favourite projects. It is telegram bot that removes background image automatically. It has 2 modes for removing: first one has less quality and the second one is generate via API that means it removes with hight quality. Except from that you can invite friends and also you can draw line on the transparent images. For now it is only in Uzbek language. <a href="https://t.me/orqa_fonni_kesuvchi_bot">Link for the bot</a></td>
