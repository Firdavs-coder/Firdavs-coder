      Hi, my name is Firdavs. I am 17 years old, from Uzbekistan, Central Asia. I know some basic programming languages such as:
      <ul>
         <br>
         <li>Frontend: html, css, bootstrap, js, jquery but I am not good at web frontend basicly at js.</li>
         <li>Backend: python, django, django rest framework. It is my primary programming work</li>
         <li>Flutter: I also create mobile apps for both android and ios in flutter. Flutter is a cross platform which provides many opportunities with main one codebase.</li>
      </ul>
